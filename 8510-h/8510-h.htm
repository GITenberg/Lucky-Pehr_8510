        SCENE: A Room in the Church Tower.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Window shutters at back wide open, starlit sky is seen through windows.
        Background: Snow covered house-roofs; gable windows in the distance
        brilliantly illuminated. In room an old chair, a fire-pan and a picture
        of the Virgin, with a lighted candle before it. Room is divided by posts&mdash;two
        in centre thick enough to conceal an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chant, in unison, from the church below:

      <p>
        [Old Man comes up tower steps and enters carrying a rat-trap, a
        barley-sheaf and a dish of porridge, which he sets down on the floor.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Now the elf shall have his Christmas porridge. And this year he
        has earned it honestly&mdash;twice he awakened me when I fell asleep and
        forgot the tower shutters; once he rang the bell when fire broke loose.
        Merry Christmas, Elf! and many of them. [Takes up rat-trap and sets it.]
        Here's your Christmas mess, Satan's rats!
      </p>
      <p>
        A VOICE. Curse not Christmas!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. I believe there are spirits about to-night&mdash;Ugh! it's the
        cold increasing; then the beams always creak, like an old ship. Here's
        your Christmas supper. Now perhaps you'll quit gnawing the bell-rope and
        eating up the tallow, you accursed pest!
      </p>
      <p>
        A VOICE. Curse not Christmas!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. The spooks are at it again! Christmas eve&mdash;yes, yes!
        [Places rat-trap on the floor.] There! Now they have their portion. And
        now comes the turn of the feathered wretches. They must have grain, of
        course, so they can soil the tin roof for me. Such is life! The church
        wardens pay for it, so it's not my affair. But if I were to ask for an
        extra shilling two in wages&mdash;that they couldn't afford. That
        wouldn't be seen! But when one sticks out a grain-sheaf on a pole once a
        year, it looks generous. Ah, that one is a fine fellow!&mdash;and
        generosity is a virtue. Now, if we were to share and share alike, I
        should get back my porridge, which I gave to the elf. [Shakes sheaf and
        gathers the grain into a bowl.]
      </p>
      <p>
        A VOICE. He robs Christmas! He robs Christmas!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Now I'll put this thing on the pole so that it will look like a
        symbol, and as a symbol it will also be of service&mdash;for it shows
        what is not to be found within. [He puts sheaf through window and hangs
        it on pole, then shakes his fist at town below.] Oh, you old human pit
        down there! I spit on you! [Spits through window; comes down and sees
        the burning candle before the Virgin's picture.] This must be the boy's
        doings! The times are not such that one burns up candles needlessly.
        [Snuffs out light and puts the candle into his pocket.]
      </p>
      <p>
        A VOICE. Woe! Woe! [Head of Virgin shakes three times and a bright ray
        of light darts out from the head.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. [Shrinking.] Is hell let loose to-night?
      </p>
      <p>
        A VOICE. Heaven!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Pehr, Pehr! Where are you? My eyes! Light the candles&mdash;My
        son, my son!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIRGIN'S IMAGE. <i>My</i> SON!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. [Groping his way toward the stairs.] My eyes! Hell-fire! [He
        rushes down the steps.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Two rats, Nisse and Nilla, come on right, one behind the other. They
        have mourning veils swathed about their tails.]
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. I say, it smells like roast pig!
      </p>
      <p>
        NILLA. Oh, I promise you! Be careful, Nisse! I see the trap over there.
        [Sits on hind legs.] 'Twas in that very trap that our little ones were
        lost! O dear, dear, dear!
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. If we could only hit upon some trick to play on the bad old man
        it would do my bowels good! Can you see if he has left anything about
        which he values?
      </p>
      <p>
        NILLA. Suppose we gnaw the ropes so the bells will tumble down on his
        head&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. Why, Nilla! you know that I have only one poor tooth left in my
        head.
      </p>
      <p>
        NILLA. But I have two&mdash;and where there's a will there's&mdash;but
        you, you have no feeling for your children!
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. Come now! we shan't quarrel on Christmas Eve.
      </p>
      <p>
        NILLA. Hush! What have we here?
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. A dish of porridge&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        NILLA. Which the old man has left&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. For the elf. He's afraid of him!
      </p>
      <p>
        NILLA. Now I know! We'll eat up the porridge so&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. The elf will get after him&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        NILLA. And he can raise the mischief when he gets angry. [They are over
        by the dish now, and eating.]
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. Oh, move along and make room for me!
      </p>
      <p>
        NILLA. Hush! It creaks in the stairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. Now I see the bottom of the dish; there's the lump of butter!
      </p>
      <p>
        NILLA. Help me with this corner.
      </p>
      <p>
        NISSE. Ah!&mdash;now we'll wipe our mouths and run. [They scurry off
        left.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Elf slides down bell-rope.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. [Walks about and searches.] Where's my Christmas porridge? I
        scented its aroma a long way off. It will taste good to me on a cold
        night, like this. I hope he has given me a big lump of butter this year,
        since I have been so good to him. [Loosens belt.] There! get you ready,
        my stomach. I'll let out two holes in the belt, which will make it about
        right. [He sees dish.] Ah, ha! what's this? Empty dishes! What has come
        over the old man-hater? Has he grown stingy and arrogant, or does he
        mock me, when he sets out an empty dish! There has been porridge here
        [smells]&mdash;butter, too! Well, well, old man! I'm sorry for you, but
        I shall have to punish you. The elf is for the purpose of punishing and
        rewarding. I must sit down and think out some <i>real</i> Christmas
        gift. [Sits in chair.] Let me see! The old man shuts himself up in this
        place with his son, whom he wishes to shield from the evils and shams of
        the world. The old man has seen much of the world, and hates it; the
        young one has never been beyond the church door and has seen the world
        only from the tower. But I know that it tempts him, just because he has
        seen it like this&mdash;from a bird's-eye view. The old man has but one
        wish in life&mdash;that his son shall succeed him and thus be spared the
        struggles of life and the cruelty of men. It is this wish which I shall
        cross; it is his only vulnerable point. Well and good! I'll call his
        godmother. She shall take the boy in hand and show him all the glories
        of the world; afterwards, there will be nothing more for the old man to
        do in the matter. The dreams of youth&mdash;I know their powers. Well,
        then! [Blows a whistle.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Fairy dressed like an old witch, with brown cloak and cane, emerges
        from behind a post.]
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Good evening, lad.
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. Good evening, old lady. Can you corrupt a young man?&mdash;Oh!
        understand me aright.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. That depends&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. It won't go in that costume! You see, it's a question of the old
        man's son.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Our Pehr?
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. Just he! Hush, old lady, I'm talking now! The boy is very dear to
        my heart&mdash;that he has been ever since his birth. We&mdash;you and I&mdash;stood
        sponsor for him, and we each have our duties. His education is being
        neglected; he has seen nothing of the world, although he is fifteen
        to-day. I want him to go out and look around so he will be a credit to
        us. Have you anything against it?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Nothing. But I fear that he will meet with difficulties out there
        which we cannot adjust, since our power does not extend beyond these
        church walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. True; and I must search my brain for another idea. Ah&mdash;I have
        it! We'll each give him his godgift, which can serve him in all
        conditions of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. And what shall you give? Let us hear!
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. Life is rather ticklish, as you know, and the boy is young! He has
        not as yet, through proper training, had time to learn all the arts by
        which one gains one's wishes. Now, I ask nothing more of life, for I
        know what it gives; therefore he shall have my wish-ring. And you?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. I daresay that gift is a good one, but when once he has got all
        that he wished for, he will have made his journey like the blind;
        therefore I shall give him a gift which will show him matter's face
        value&mdash;I shall give him good company on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. Feminine?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. You're a wise one! No&mdash;now you shall take charge of the lad
        and see that he gets away.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. But how? He fears and obeys his father.
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. Fiddlesticks! Do your hokus-pokus and show him all the glories down
        there, in the Christmas-bedecked homes. Then it will go fast enough!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Do you think so?
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. I know the young. Here's my ring&mdash;and now to business!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Is it right to play with human destiny?
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. We only play with human beings, their destinies we do not control.
        Soon or late, the boy will go out into the world, and he is better
        equipped than many who have faced life before him. When his journey is
        over, we can discuss the subject more at length. Are you ready?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. [Going toward post.] Immediately. [Fairy disappears.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. Then I'll whistle. [Disappears behind the other post.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Pehr comes down steps leading from top of tower.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who's there?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. [Appears suddenly, dressed in white.] Your godmother, Pehr. Don't
        you know me?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Ah! you are the one who caught me in your arms that time, when I
        fell from the tower. What do you want of me to-day?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. I want to give you a Christmas gift.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. A gift? What is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Something that gives one pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Pleasure?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Fulfillment of one's wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Wishes! Now I begin to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. When standing out there on the balcony, have you never felt as if
        something were drawing you&mdash;sort of enticing you down?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, that I have felt. You see the black streak over there, where
        light and darkness meet? In the daytime it looks different; and when the
        wind blows, it moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. The forest.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What is it like in the forest?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. It is cool and delightful.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. That's well! Thither I am drawn, sometimes, so powerfully that I
        want to rush through the tower window and soar, like the birds in the
        air!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Beyond the borders of the forest?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Is there something beyond?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. There lies the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. The world! What is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Would you like to see it?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Is it pleasant?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Some say it is; the majority say it is not. Come over here and I
        will show you some pictures from that checkered panorama which people
        call life. [Transparency curtain.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you see the great house on the square, where all the windows are
        lighted? The rich man lives there. Now look into the rooms. On the table
        there is a lighted Christmas-tree laden with all kinds of gifts: the
        golden fruits of the tropics from across the seas; earth's hidden
        treasures, to which people bend the knee and which in their dazzling
        settings reflect the lights. But, do you see the light in the faces of
        the little children? That is the earth-life's sun&mdash;that is <i>happiness</i>&mdash;which
        is something you do not know, poor child! But you shall know it. You
        want to, do you not?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who is the good fairy that walks about and gives the children the
        golden fruits?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. That is the mother.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Mother?&mdash;I don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. You, too, had a mother, but she died when you were very young.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And the old man in the corner, with the mild look in his eyes?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. He is the father, who in memory is living over his childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. The father! But he looks so pleasant.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Yes, for he loves some one besides himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And the youth who puts his arm around the young girl's waist&mdash;[Eagerly.]
        Now he presses his face against hers&mdash;their lips meet&mdash;what
        does that mean? Does one speak like that in life?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. That is love's way of speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Love! Then it must be glorious to see it all!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Wait! Now look up there, in the gable window&mdash;a single
        candle burns, a poor, wretched light. [Tableau.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Poverty! That I know. Show me something pretty!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. [Regarding him.] You are pleasure loving. Very well!&mdash;Look
        again up there, around the same Christmas light&mdash;it shines dimly
        but warmly on the contented table of poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No! I want to see something beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Really! Is there anything more beautiful than&mdash;but, wait!
        you shall see&mdash;Now look over yonder&mdash;toward the castle, where
        the King lives. [Tableau.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Do you see the beautiful robes, the glittering jewels? Do you see
        how the walls reflect the brilliant lights and how in the middle of
        winter real roses and blue lilies are in bloom?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. And the young girls, with the flowing locks, who serve wine in
        silver goblets&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. <i>There</i> I want to be!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. And now stewards, in white, carry on the dishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. The heralds rap on the floor with their staves&mdash;the trumpets
        sound&mdash;[Three strokes of a bell are heard; the tower chamber takes
        on its former appearance.] Alas! the time is up. Pehr, do you wish to go
        out and taste of life?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, yes!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Good and bad?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Bad? That I think I know; the good I would learn to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. You think so? But you shall soon see that all which seems good is
        not good, and all that seems bad is not bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Only let me get out&mdash;and away from here!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. You may go; but first I want to give you, as a help on your
        journey, a gift which will be of service to you. When you have it, you
        will have been given more than others, and therefore more will be
        required of you at some future time.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Let me see it!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. This ring has the power to grant you all your wishes&mdash;to
        your credit, but to no one's harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. That's a fine ring! But what will the old man say?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. He is only going to meet with his just punishment&mdash;punishment
        for his selfishness.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, that is just. All the same I feel sorry for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Do not grieve for him; I shall watch over his sorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Sorrow! Nothing else? Sorrow, he says, is the one pleasure in
        life. Let him sit and enjoy it then. I shall probably furnish him with
        opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. And lastly, young man, will you take provisions from the Wise
        Man?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What should they be?&mdash;Good advice?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Alas, I have such quantities of that!
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. I know that, and I know its fate. Farewell then! May life so
        teach you to live that when your journey is over you shall be&mdash;whether
        great or obscure; successful or unsuccessful; learned or ignorant&mdash;a
        man, and above all, a manly man. Farewell! [Fairy disappears in column.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Alone.] Well, Pehr, you are going out into life! Others before
        you have probably done likewise. But is it, then, so difficult out
        there? To be sure I have stood on the church roof and watched the
        throngs of people down in the street crawl around each other, going and
        coming. To me they appear so quiet and orderly, and I don't see that
        they trample on one another, although they are as thick as gnats. That
        dogs and apprentices fight sometimes, that I have seen, but grown folk&mdash;never!
        The old man and I never fight, although we pass each other on the stairs
        ten times a day. True, he has beaten me, but I have never beaten him;
        and other people may not be so bad either, if the truth were told.
        Wasn't there a fire the other day in the house of a rich merchant and
        didn't a lot of poor wretches come running from all directions, and
        didn't they go up to the rich man's place and save his goods? Oh, yes, I
        saw how they took silver pieces from his table and carried them far out
        of the city, where they hid them behind haystacks so the silver wouldn't
        be burned up. Wasn't that kind of them? We shall see, we shall see!
        Meanwhile, my dear Pehr, you shall go out and have a look at the world
        and make use of your gifts. [Examines ring.] Let's see! What shall I
        wish for first?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Old man enters as if through wall.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh! so the old man is here. I did not hear your footsteps on the
        stairs. Which way did you come?
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. [Alarmed.] Did you see?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Let me look at you! [Gazes fixedly at him.] Something has
        happened here&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Nothing&mdash;nothing whatever!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. My son, it will soon be midnight. Don't you want to retire to
        your room so that I may lock you in?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. You always want to shut me in! Tell me, Father, have you never
        meant to let me out in the world? Surely you cannot have thought that I
        should sit here forever, and dry up!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. I have seen life; I know its Sodom apples&mdash;therefore I
        wish to shield you.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But life is not as sour as you say, perhaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. What do you know about it?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh, I can see things from my high place! Come here and I will show
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. What can you show me that I do not already know?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Leads Old Man to the window.] Look! Do you see the great house on
        the square?
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Yes; but make haste! Before the clock strikes twelve, you must
        be in bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Do you see the Christmas-tree, with its gold and silver?
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Only paper, boy!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And the golden fruits of the tropics?
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Worm-eaten&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And the sun&mdash;Happiness&mdash;how it shines on the children's
        faces!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Between times distorted by envy&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And the old man who sits there, contented and happy&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. It's a lie! He trembles in his heart for the house rent, which
        must be paid on the new year&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. He&mdash;the rich man?
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Hides his approaching downfall!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And those young people&mdash;Do you see how he stretches his arm&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. After the father's money bag!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Shame on you! Their lips meet&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. In lust!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What is that?&mdash;Ah! Now look up there, at the gable window,
        with the single light&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Prompted by caution, which demands darkness&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. By the glow of contentment's calm light&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Which they stole from the spice stall, and their delight is in
        planning the next expedition to the city market. I know it, do you hear!
        And up there, in the palace, where the lights glisten by the thousands
        and mirror themselves in the wines' sour streams&mdash;there they roll&mdash;empty
        heads and empty hearts&mdash;who say that they think and feel for the
        people's welfare! There they roll, between bottles and dishes&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Why do you talk so fast? Let me continue&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. No! Away with you and obey, boy!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, away from here! I want to go out and see the world. I want to
        see child-faces&mdash;even if they can be clouded by envy's cankerworm!
        I want to taste the fruit of the tropics even if it is worm-eaten! I
        would drink the wine though it were gall, and I want to put my arm
        around a maid's waist, even if a bankrupt father does sit at the hearth
        stone! I want silver and gold&mdash;if in the end it is nothing but
        dross!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Hell-fire! who's been here?
      </p>
      <p>
        A VOICE. Curse not Christmas!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What can this mean? It is so strange here to-night&mdash;stranger
        than usual. Father, look at me! Why, that's not his face!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. [Kneeling.] My son! Listen to your father&mdash;obey the old
        man, who wishes you only good; remain within these peaceful walls!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. It is too late!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. What do I see?&mdash;that ring! who gave it to you? [Tries to
        take the ring from Pehr.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who are you? You are not my father!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD MAN. Your guilty, your unhappy father, who is bound by the
        witchcraft of the Powers! [Old Man is transformed into a big black cat.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Jesu Maria, help! [Bright rays dart out from Virgin's image; clock
        strikes twelve.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. The witch! The witch! Away, unclean spirit! [Cat vanishes.] And
        now&mdash;[opens tower shutters] for life! [Fingers ring.] To the
        forest. [Going through window.] <i>Out</i>!

        ACT TWO
      </h2>
      <h3>
        SCENE ONE.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Snow-clad woods; diagonally across stage is an ice-covered brook. Dawn.
        Wind blows through the trees as curtain rises. Pehr on.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. So this is the forest, whither my thoughts have so often flown
        through the clear air, and this is the snow! Now I want to throw
        snowballs, as I've seen school boys do. It is supposed to be something
        uncommonly amusing. [He takes up some snow and casts a few snowballs.]
        H-m! That's not so wonderful! Once again&mdash;I think it almost stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what is it that plays up in the tree tops? The wind&mdash;Ah, it
        sounds rather well. Zoo, zoo, zoo! But one grows sleepy if one listens
        to that long. Zoo, zoo, zoo! Now it sounds like the gnats on a summer's
        evening. Strange how short everything is out here in Nature! The
        dullness in the tower&mdash;that was long! Now it's not at all pretty or
        amusing. [Sees brook.] Why, what is this? Ice! What pleasure can one get
        from that? Ah, now I remember&mdash;one can skate on it. I must try
        that! [He goes out on the brook; slides; ice cracks; he falls from
        fright and lies there, stunned.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Lisa.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. [Runs up to Pehr.] There he is! Ah&mdash;he sleeps! [Sees
        something that glitters.] What is that? [Picks up ring, which Pehr
        dropped when he fell.] A ring! He is sleeping in the snow! What can have
        happened? He is hurt! What can I do? In the very heart of the forest and
        right in the snow! Not a human being comes this way. He'll freeze to
        death if he cannot get away. The good fairy sent me here to look up that
        boy, but she did not tell me that I should find him half dead in a snow
        drift! If only it were summer, with the sun shining on the green
        grass-carpet&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        [Lisa fingers ring. Transformation: Landscape is changed from winter
        into summer; brook loses ice-cake and runs forth between the stones; sun
        shines on the whole.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. What can be the meaning of this! [Amazed, glances in all
        directions. Pehr awakens.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Rubbing his eyes.] Why, what is this&mdash;I fly from the church
        tower, come into a forest of snow, throw snowballs, skate, bump my head
        on the ice, lose my senses&mdash;then I wake up and find that it is
        summer! Have I been lying here under the snow six months? No, it doesn't
        seem likely. [Looks at himself in the brook.] I'm as red as a rose.
        [Bends over water.] But what do I see down in the deep&mdash;A blue sky,
        green trees, white water-lilies, and right in their midst&mdash;a girl!&mdash;just
        like the one the youth had his arm around in the Christmas-home: flowing
        hair, a mouth like a song, eyes like the dove's!&mdash;Ah! she nods to
        me&mdash;I'm coming, I'm coming! [About to plunge into the brook, when
        Lisa gives a cry. He turns.] There she is! A moment ago she was down
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. So it seems, but do not always believe your eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. A strange world, this! But let me see if it is the same girl?
        [Stares at her.] Yes, it is she. [Starts to run toward her, then catches
        sight of ring.] What! my ring? You robbed me while I lay senseless! Oh,
        do not believe your eyes, you said. No! for now I have my first lesson&mdash;I
        wanted to embrace an angel, and I find a thief.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Do not always believe your eyes, Pehr; investigate before you
        judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. You are right. I shall do so. Girl, who are you? What is your
        name?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Lisa is my name, but who I am you must not know until the time is
        fulfilled. I came here and found you senseless&mdash;on the ice I found
        your ring, the powers of which I did not know.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. You have saved me from certain death in the snow. Forgive me!
        Lisa, you shall go with me on my journey, and you shall see a jolly
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. You are traveling, you say&mdash;What is the object of your
        journey?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I seek&mdash;like all the rest&mdash;happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. You seek happiness! That is a fleeting thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Ah, say not so! I can have all that I wish for. Have we not been
        given the most delightful summer in the middle of winter? See how
        gloriously the sun shines up in the pines! You must know that all this
        is new to me. Oh, look! [Picks up a few spruce-cones.] What are these?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. The fruit of the trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Then it is good to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. No; but children play with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Play&mdash;that I have never done! Shall we play, Lisa?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Yes&mdash;but what? Shall we play a game of tag?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. How does it go?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Watch me! [She runs behind a tree and throws cones at Pehr.] Now
        catch me!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Running after her.] But that's not so easily done! [Steps on a
        cone and hurts his foot.] The damned spruce apples!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Mustn't curse the fruit of the trees!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. One can do without such fruit! I prefer the kind I saw on a
        Christmas-tree. If this spruce could bear such fruit, then&mdash;[Instantly
        spruce bears oranges.] Look, look! Let us taste. [They pick fruit and
        eat.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Well, what think you?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh! it's rather good&mdash;but not quite what I had fancied.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. So it is always&mdash;all through life.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. My dear girl, how wise you are! Lisa, may I put my arm around your
        waist? [A bird in the tree begins to sing softly.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Yes; but what for?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. May I kiss you also?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Yes&mdash;there's no harm in that, surely. [Bird sings louder.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I'm so warm after the play, Lisa! Shall we bathe in the brook?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. [Covers her eyes with her hands.] Bathe!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Throws off coat.] Yes!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. [Hides behind a tree.] No, no, no! [Bird sings.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who is that screech-owl up in the tree?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. It is a bird that sings.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What does he sing about?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Hush! I understand bird language; that my godmother taught me.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. It will be fun hearing about it! [Bird sings.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. "Not so, not so!" he said just then. [Bird sings again.] Pehr, do
        you know what he said then?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. "Live guiltless! Mine eye seeth thee."
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Guiltless&mdash;what is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. I don't know&mdash;but dress yourself!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. It's only nonsense; there's no one here to see us. [Cuckoo calls.]
        Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What is that rogue calling?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. [Imitates cuckoo.] Cuckoo, cuckoo!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What a lot of tiresome formalities there has got to be!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Can you not enjoy the great, innocent pleasures of Nature?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, for a little while&mdash;What was that? [Tears off vest.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. An ant.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Beats right and left with his hat.] Only look at all the horrid
        pests! Ouch! what was it that stung me? A mosquito!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Everything here in life is incomplete, Pehr. Remember that, and
        take the bad with the good.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Deuce take the bad! I want the good. [Beats at the air.] Now I'm
        tired of the for est. Surely one cannot play all one's life! I yearn for
        activity, and want to be among people. Tell me, Lisa&mdash;you, who are
        such a wise little creature, what do people value most? For that I shall
        procure for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Pehr, before I answer you, listen to a sensible word! People will
        cause you just as much annoyance as the mosquitoes do, but they will not
        give you the delight to be found in Nature's perennial youth.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Nature!&mdash;Oh, yes, it is very pretty when seen from a church
        tower, but it becomes rather monotonous near to. Doesn't everything
        stand still? Don't the trees stand in the selfsame places where they
        stood fifty years ago, and won't they be standing there fifty years
        hence? My eyes are already weary of <i>this</i> splendor! I want
        movement and noise, and if the people are like mosquitoes, it will be so
        much easier to keep them at a distance than this company. [Beats about
        his head with his hat.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. You'll see, no doubt, you'll see! Experience will teach you better
        than my word.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And now, Lisa, what do people value most in a person?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. I'm ashamed to say it.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. You must tell me!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Gold.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Gold? But that is something outside the person which does not
        belong to his being.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Yes, that is known; but it is so nevertheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What extraordinary qualities does gold possess?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. All! It is good for everything&mdash;and nothing. It gives all
        that earth has to offer; in itself it is the most perfect of all the
        earth's products which rust cannot spot&mdash;but which can put
        rust-spots into souls.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Well, then! Will you follow me, Lisa?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. I will always follow you&mdash;at a distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. At a distance! and why not near me? Lisa, now I shall put my arm
        around your waist again. [Lisa tears herself away; bird sings.] Why do
        you run away?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Ask the bird!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I can't understand what he says; you must tell me.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. [Embarrassed.] No, I cannot!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Cannot? What is it?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. He is not singing for us now. He sings to his sweetheart, so you
        must know what he is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. How should I know that!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. He says like this: [Running off] "I love you, I love you!"
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Stay! Shall you run away from me? Lisa! Lisa! She's gone! Very
        well then! Come hither palace and plates and wines and horses and
        chariots and gold&mdash;gold!
      </p>
      SCENE TWO.
      <p>
        A luxurious Banquet Hall. Servants bring on a table, with food and
        wines; other servants carry in a chest containing gold; others, again, a
        table covered with plates, vases, candle-sticks, etc.&mdash;all of gold.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Walks about and looks around.] So this is the rich man's abode!
        Well, it looks rather promising. Slaves! Give me my best holiday-coat&mdash;but
        it must be of gold. [Servants hand him a gold-cloth coat.] A chair!
        [They place a gold chair at table.] Now, Pehr, you shall enjoy life! and
        that is your right. Haven't you been up mornings at four o'clock; and
        rung for early Mass; haven't you swept the church on Fridays and scoured
        the stairs on Saturdays; haven't you eaten bread and herring three
        hundred and sixty-five days in the year and rinsed them down with cold
        water; haven't you slept on pease-bolt which was so badly threshed that
        you could feel the pease in your knee-joints? Oh, yes, you have&mdash;therefore
        enjoy yourself! [Wants to sit at table.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. [With staff in hand.] Pardon, Your Grace! The table is not laid.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. In a couple of hours the roasts will be ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I don't want any roasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. [Intercepts Pehr with staff.] It can never be that one sits down
        at an unlaid table!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who forbids me in my own house?
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. Etiquette, Your Grace, does not under any circumstances permit
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Etiquette! What kind of torment is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. Your Grace, listen to an old man's word! He who in Your Grace's
        position violates the rules of etiquette is lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Frightened.] What a harsh gentleman! I shall have to submit,
        although I'm beastly hungry&mdash;But, wait! Is there nothing that will
        move that gentleman? I have heard that gold&mdash;[Goes over to chest
        and takes out a handful of gold coins.] Would not&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. Your Grace! I stand above the servants; above me stands Your
        Grace, but above us all stands&mdash;Conventionality. Its laws are
        perpetual, for they have their foundation both in common sense and in
        what we call historical hypotheses.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And the historical hypotheses&mdash;cannot they be reached with
        gold?
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. They are non-corruptible&mdash;in this instance!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What's the good of all my wealth if I cannot eat my fill when I'm
        hungry? I am worse off than the poorest bellringer.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Butler stations himself at the table, and stands like a statue.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Tax Assessor and assistants, who walk about and take an
        inventory.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Look&mdash;here's a new torture! With what shall you gentlemen
        pester an innocent victim?
      </p>
      <p>
        TAX ASSESSOR. Taxation, Your Grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Indeed! So it is you who regulate people's worth. How high is a
        human being estimated these days?
      </p>
      <p>
        TAX ASSESSOR. Two per hundred, Your Grace;&mdash;all depends on what one
        is good for.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Tell me, can't I withdraw while the gentlemen figure up? for I am
        both hungry and thirsty.
      </p>
      <p>
        TAX ASSESSOR. Impossible! It must be done in the owner's presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. O Lord, what trials! But I may be allowed to sit down at least?
      </p>
      <p>
        TAX ASSESSOR. As you please! [To assistants.] Two dozen plates with
        beveled edges&mdash;write! Six wine-coolers, with handles of finer metal&mdash;write!
        One sugar bowl, with sifting spoon, and two smaller ditto&mdash;write!
        Two dozen knives, with handles of mother-of-pearl&mdash;brand new&mdash;write!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. See if I don't go crazy!
      </p>
      <p>
        TAX ASSESSOR. Dining table of oak, with double leaves&mdash;write! Six
        walnut chairs. [Enter Lawyer.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. One more!
      </p>
      <p>
        LAWYER. Your Grace is summoned to the City Court to have tax No. 2867
        legalized before twelve o'clock this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. The Court? Litigation? I never institute proceedings, sir!
      </p>
      <p>
        LAWYER. It's not a question of litigation&mdash;only to verify facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I don't wish to verify facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        LAWYER. But to put the case&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I don't want to put the case&mdash;I want my dinner! Butler, can't
        I take a sandwich? [Butler raises staff threateningly; enter petty
        constable.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Are there still more?
      </p>
      <p>
        PETTY CONSTABLE. Your Grace is summoned to the Bar tomorrow at eleven
        o'clock for neglecting to keep the street clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Must I keep the street clean&mdash;I, who am such a rich man!
        What, then, must I not do?
      </p>
      <p>
        PETTY CONSTABLE. It is the duty of every householder to keep clean in
        front of his own house.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Etiquette, taxation, put the case, keep yard and street clean,
        hunger and thirst&mdash;is that the rich man's lot! Then I would rather
        be a street sweeper and own myself. And I'm not allowed to turn these
        gentlemen out, who crowd into my room, and I cannot go my way when I
        choose!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter petitioner, followed by a servant carrying two baskets of
        papers.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Mr. Lawyer and Mr. Constable, can't the law protect an unfortunate
        rich man so that he may have peace in his home, or is the law only for
        the poor?
      </p>
      <p>
        LAWYER. Your Grace can no longer be regarded as an individual; for when
        one through riches has risen to the community's heights, one belongs to
        the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And so one is placed outside the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        LAWYER. [Smiles; glances about.] Above the law, Your Grace!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Ha&mdash;! What does this last friend want! Are there any presents
        in those baskets?
      </p>
      <p>
        PETITIONER. Your Honorable Grace is appointed Church Warden&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Interrupts.] Called&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PETITIONER. Called to vote day after to-morrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Eleven o'clock&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PETITIONER. Eleven o'clock-to be present at the election of the new
        Rector. But before that, Your Grace must take part in the preliminaries
        which are here inclosed, and which are for the purpose of showing the
        incompetence of the opposing candidate for the office.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Must I read through two baskets full of papers between now and day
        after to-morrow? No, no!
      </p>
      <p>
        PETITIONER. Perhaps Your Grace would like to give your vote to our
        candidate&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Without having to read&mdash;is that permissible? Thank you, my
        good friend! Pen and ink!
      </p>
      <p>
        PETITIONER. [Hands Pehr pen, ink and paper for signature.] Admirable! I
        thank Your Grace.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Embracing him.] Ah, it is I that must thank you!
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. [Raps on table three times with staff; servants enter with
        dishes.] Dinner is served. [All go except Pehr and butler.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Sits down at table.] At last! [Soft music.] See, now they go when
        he commands; but when I beg, it's useless!
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. It is not my command they obey, Your Grace, but the rules of
        etiquette.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And they transcend my will?
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. Laws are the agreements of many, and must of course come before
        the individual's will.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I declare, he can answer all things! Now I shall enjoy myself at
        all events. Wine warms the heart, food warms the body&mdash;but where's
        the pleasure in loneliness? Mr. Butler, do the rules of etiquette permit
        that one has company when one is enjoying oneself?
      </p>
      <p>
        BUTLER. I almost believe that something in that way is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Well, then, I want&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        [First Friend enters and rushes into Pehr's arms.]
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. Friend of my heart! So I see thee again after such a long
        separation! And you are like yourself&mdash;a little thinner than when I
        last saw you; but how's everything now, dear old chap?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Eyeing him.] Oh, thanks, thanks&mdash;very well indeed, as&mdash;ahem&mdash;you
        see. Pray take a chair and sit down.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. Why, bless my soul! I've just had dinner, but I'll go into
        your ante-room and wait there while you finish yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No, that is just what you shall not do! I remarked a while ago
        that I thought life so empty when one must sit alone at table. Take a
        chair and sit down.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. Dear old friend, if you insist I will sit beside you while
        you dine; but it actually looks as though I had come here for a meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What matter even if it were so.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. [Protests.] Oh&mdash;!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Wait a bit&mdash;I'm not saying that it is so!
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. [Seats himself.] So now you are in clover, as they say. It
        is pleasant to contemplate that fate can be so kindly, and it must ever
        rejoice a sensitive soul to see that some one is favored by fickle
        fortune. Not all&mdash;more's the pity!&mdash;can praise fickle fortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Indeed! Have you any grievances?
      </p>
      FIRST FRIEND. I?
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes&mdash;for I don't want to hear any hard-luck stories now, when
        I'm eating. Won't you be good enough to favor me by trying a
        hazel-grouse?
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. If you speak of favors, my friend!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Then you mustn't say "my friend"; you must call me by name.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. Christopher! You ask a service of poor me&mdash;can I then
        deny you! [He begins to eat, his appetite increases during following
        repartee. Pehr regards him with open-eyed wonder.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. One should never deny another anything?
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. Well said! One should never deny oneself anything&mdash;one
        another, I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Second Friend.]
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND FRIEND. [Walking straight up to the table.] Good day, Goran! Do
        you remember me? [Pehr Stares at him.] No you don't, but I remember you.
        You see, I never forget my old friends! In the hour of need I look them
        up. Here you sit and eat and I have nothing to eat, therefore I say
        right out: Boy, here am I! [Seats himself at table.]
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. [To Pehr.] Who is that tramp? He eats as though he had not
        seen food from Christmas to Easter!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh, he's a friend of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND FRIEND. [To Pehr.] Who is that beggar? He stuffs himself like a.
        wolf in the springtime!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh, he is a good friend of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. [To Pehr.] Beware false friends, Pehr!
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND FRIEND. [To Pehr.] Beware false friends, Pehr!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, yes!
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. [To Pehr.] You'll see, he is going to borrow money from
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND FRIEND. [To Pehr.] If he asks for a loan from you, you must say
        no&mdash;for he never pays.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. You don't say so! Well, good friends, don't you think this an
        excellent repast?
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND FRIEND. I never flatter!
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. No, my friend, you only stuff yourself! I never flatter,
        either, but I cannot therefore mask the truth and must acknowledge that
        anything of this sort I have never before had a share in, and it has to
        be Christopher that offers such a treat! Your health, brother
        Christopher!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Aghast.] Christopher?
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND FRIEND. I'm a plain, everyday sort of man, and cannot make pretty
        speeches&mdash;which I scorn, and the expression of which from such a
        source I can ascribe only to a secret desire to get money. That is my
        plain, everyday opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. What insolence!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I must beg that no serious discussions interrupt this delightful
        gathering, which would be even more agreeable if it were sweetened by
        some charming representative of the opposite sex.
      </p>
      <p>
        [A Woman appears.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Behold!
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. So you couldn't wait for me! That was most impolite, but I
        forgive you since you are my friend. There's my hand!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Kisses her hand.] I beg a thousand pardons, my beauty, but I must
        have been mistaken as to the day? Meanwhile, be seated. Will my friends
        make room at my side? [Friends crowd nearer to him.] No? Well, he who is
        the younger must do so. That perhaps you do not know? Then he who is my
        best friend will voluntarily give up his place, for he is always just as
        near to my heart anyhow. [Both friends give up their places.] I see that
        you are both my best friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. And I your best friend among women. Am I not, Alonzo?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Quite right. And now as I raise the bumper, I want to drain it to
        Friendship! Friendship is like gold, for it is pure.
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. [To friends.] How prettily he speaks!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Friendship is like the moon&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        THREE FRIENDS. Bravo! Bravo!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. For it borrows its gold&mdash;[Three Friends exchange glances]&mdash;from
        the sun. And it darkens when the sun departs; true, is it not?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALL THREE FRIENDS. [Sullenly.] Very well said!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But friendship is a fire; it must be fed if it is to be kept
        burning. You have given me your friendship, what have I to give you?
        [Three friends glance around.] You look on my gold. Alack, it is but
        dust as compared with your friendship!
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. [Adroitly.] One must not despise the temporal because the eternal
        exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        FRIENDS. Admirably expressed!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Very well, I wish to reward your faith. See&mdash;all this gold I
        give you!
      </p>
      <p>
        ALL THREE FRIENDS. Ah! [They upset the table.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But remember, I have told you that gold is nothing but dross.
        [Puts hand to mouth and paces back and forth.] O my God! I believe I'm
        dying!
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. What's wrong with you, Alonzo?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I've got the toothache&mdash;oh, my teeth! You see that the rich
        man, also, is exposed to the annoyances of life. [Friends, with gold
        pieces, move toward doors.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No, don't leave me alone in my misery&mdash;now, when I most need
        your company!
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. Oh, a little toothache is not dangerous; it will soon
        pass!
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND FRIEND. Take some cold water in your mouth, then you'll be all
        right.
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. Oh, the men! They are so sensitive to a little pain. You should
        see a woman suffer!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Ah, don't forsake me! I suffer so terribly!
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST FRIEND. I shall never forsake you! [Hand on door.] I'll run for
        the dentist.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No, stay!
      </p>
      <p>
        SECOND FRIEND. [Near door.] No; as George's oldest friend it devolves
        upon me to&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. You want to run away from me! Oh, I curse this gold! I curse you,
        false friends! [Gold pieces in their hands turn black.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ALL THREE FRIENDS. He has deceived us&mdash;look, look! [All three are
        stricken with toothache and begin to moan.] Oh! Oh!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Recovered.] Oh, it's only a little toothache; it will soon pass.&mdash;Take
        cold water in your mouth, old friend, and then it will disappear. [Woman
        faints.] Surely a woman will not faint for such a little pain! [Friends
        rush out.] Now run to the dentist and let him draw all your teeth,
        foxes! After that you'll not bite any more sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. [Coming to.] Alfred! all have forsaken you; but I shall remain
        with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, but why should you? I'm as poor as the poorest; soon the tax
        collector will be coming around for the taxes, and he'll seize
        everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. [Snuggles up to him.] Then I want to be at your side to support
        you&mdash;[seizes his hand and steals ring during following speeches]
        and extend to you the hand&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Duped.] You! Can this be true?
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. True? Look at me!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Ah, I have been told that woman is more faithless than man&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. She is wiser than man [puts ring on], therefore she is called
        faithless. Oh, let me sit, I'm so unstrung! [Pehr leads her to a chair
        by the wall.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Compose yourself, my friend; I have only frightened you.
      </p>
      <p>
        WOMAN. Give me a glass of wine; I feel so faint after all this
        commotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Pehr goes over to table; wall back of the chair opens and woman and
        chair disappear. Only the hand with ring is seen as she is heard
        speaking.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Ha, ha&mdash;schoolboy! Learn from this not to trust a woman whom you
        have tricked!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Alone, Pehr runs to window and looks out, as he draws back his head, he
        has the ears of an ass.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Curses on gold, friendship and women! Now I stand alone&mdash;poor,
        deserted&mdash;with a pair of long ears and without my magic ring! Had I
        known that life was so utterly ignoble, I should have stayed at home
        with the witch. Where shall I turn to now&mdash;without friends, without
        money, without house and home? Trouble awaits me at the door. Must I
        now, in all seriousness, go out in the world and work for the attainment
        of my every wish? If only I were not so alone! Yet, why not as well be
        alone, since there is no such thing as friendship, and everything is so
        false and empty? Damnation!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Lisa.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Don't curse, Pehr!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Lisa! You do not forsake me, although I forgot you in my
        prosperous days.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. It is in our need that we find our friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Friends? A curse on friendship!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Don't, Pehr! There are real friendships in life as well as false
        friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I have now tried the good things of life, and I found only
        emptiness and vanity!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. You have tried in your way&mdash;meantime you have made the first
        plunge of youth, and now you shall be a man! You have looked for
        happiness in the wrong direction. Don't you want to go out and do good,
        enlighten your fellow-men, and be useful? For your clear vision can
        penetrate the perversion and crookedness which one finds in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And be a great man!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Great or obscure, it is all one. You shall be useful&mdash;you
        shall be a reformer who leads humanity onward and upward.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, a reformer who will be honored and idolized by the people,
        and whose name will be on everyone's lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Oh, how far you are from the truth, Pehr! You seek greatness only
        for personal honor; you shall have it and you shall have a new
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But how? My ring is gone!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. The qualities inherent in that ring are such that it can never be
        away from its owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Looks at his hand.] Ah! See, there it is! Well, then, I want to
        be a great man&mdash;a reformer; but you, Lisa, must follow me.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Not yet. But I will follow thee at a distance, and when thou dost
        meet with sorrow and need and the sun of happiness is for thee
        o'erclouded, then I will be near thee with my weak support. Go thou out
        into life, see what wrongs are done there; but when 'midst filth and
        mire thou hast seen how even the flower of beauty thrives, then think on
        this: Life is made up of both good and bad.

        ACT THREE
      </h2>
      <p>
        SCENE: A public square. To right, Courthouse arcade, above which there
        is a speakers' cage with places for Burgomaster and Councilmen; to left
        shoemaker's house, with shop window and sign; outside a bench and table,
        close to them a hen-coop and water-tub. In the centre of the square
        stands a pillory, with two neck-irons on chains, above it a bronze
        figure with a switch in its hand; to right centre, statue o f
        Burgomaster Hans Schulze, which leans toward a marble female statue
        crowned with a laurel wreath. Background: view of city.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Pillory and Statue.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. [Bows low to statue.] Good morning, Statue. Did you sleep well
        last night?
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. [Nods.] Good morning, Pillory. Did you sleep well yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. To be sure I did&mdash;and dreamed also! Can you guess what I
        dreamed?
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. [Crustily.] How should that be possible?
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. Well, I dreamt&mdash;can you imagine it?&mdash;that a reformer
        came to the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. What&mdash;a reformer? [Stamps.] Hell! how cold your feet get
        standing here; but what does one not do for glory's sake! A reformer?
        Then he, too, is to have a statue?
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. A statue&mdash;well, hardly! No, he had to play statue himself,
        at my feet, while I clasped him around the neck with both arms.
        [Neck-irons clash.] You see, he was a real reformer, and not a
        charlatan, such as you were in life!
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. Oh, bosh! You should be put to shame!
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. I should&mdash;but I always have justice on my side. [Swings
        switch.]
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. What, then, was his specialty?
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. He was a reformer in street paving.
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. In street paving? Pestilence and cowardice! He dabbles, then, in
        my profession. [Bumps into female statue.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. No; he does intelligently what you dabbled in, and you wouldn't
        be standing where you are had you not been the burgomaster's
        father-in-law!
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. Was not I the one who carried out the new idea of stone-paved
        streets?
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. Yes, that you did; but the idea was not new. And what did you
        do? In place of the soft sand in which one formerly placed one's feet,
        one must now balance oneself on jagged and rolly stones, which destroy
        both feet and shoes&mdash;save on the street which leads from your house
        to the tavern, where you let lay a footbridge of flat stones.
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. And now this reformer&mdash;or charlatan&mdash;wants to undo
        what I did?
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. He wants to tear up what you laid down and pave all the streets
        with "burgomaster" stones, so that all may be equally comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. So he's a rabid radical!
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. Yes, that's it, and he has no party politics back of him. You
        had the wagonmaker, the shoemaker, the chiropodist and the burgomaster
        with you, therefore you succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. He'd better be careful! Every stone which he removes from my
        work the people will hurl at him, and woe be unto him if he touches my
        memory!
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. Let us hope that he unmasks you, you old fraud! Do you recall
        how you happened to become one of the great ones after your death?
        First, at the funeral, the parson embroidered your virtues&mdash;for
        twenty marks; the contractor, who had grown rich on your streets,
        delivered a eulogy; the chiropodist, who acquired practice through your
        beautiful street stones, had a medallion struck of you; then the
        wagonmaker, who made money patching up wagons, named a vehicle after
        you; and last, the shoemaker held a memorial fest in your honor. Then it
        was done! Your son-in-law, the burgomaster, sent out a subscription
        blank for a statue no one dared refuse, and now you stand there.
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. Yes, I do, and it grieves you. To-day the Schulze Society will
        come with wreaths and will sing the memorial song ordered by my
        son-in-law. I daresay having to stand and listen to it will make you
        writhe.
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. I can't dispute that, but in the end we shall see if I'm not a
        true dreamer!
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. Hold your tongue! for here comes the Society.
      </p>
      <p>
        PILLORY. I shall have to hold my sides for laughter&mdash;three persons
        constitute the whole Society! Last year they were six. You're a back
        number, Schulze. Soon you'll see that they will move you into the
        ox-grove!
      </p>
      <p>
        STATUE. A people who reverence their great men and cherish past events
        can never sink so low as to consign their statues to the ox-grove.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Shoemaker comes out from his house and opens shop window.]
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. I believe there has been rain in the night, brother Schulze
        looks so shiny. If it will only be fair weather when the singing society
        makes its appearance! [Shouts back into the house.] Hans!
      </p>
      <p>
        HANS. [At window.] Yes, master.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Sit here by the window with your work, I'm going out to
        fulfil a civic duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        HANS. Yes, master.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. If you don't watch out, I'll let the strap do a dance on your
        back! Do you hear that, knave?
      </p>
      <p>
        HANS. Yes, master.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Wagonmaker, with a banner.]
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. 'Morning, Shoemaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Good morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Chiropodist, with a laurel wreath.]
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIROPODIST. Good morning, good morning. Shall we wait for the
        burgomaster? I think we'd better hurry along, it's preparing for more
        rain.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. That's just what I said to myself this morning, therefore I
        was wise and brought my raincoat.
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. The people should now assemble here and form a procession,
        but I don't see a cat! Shoemaker, didn't you tell the printer that we
        were to celebrate the Memorial Festival to-day?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Why certainly, certainly!
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. Will the gentlemen please form a semi-circle around the
        object's pedestal&mdash;so!
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIROPODIST. We might begin with the cantata&mdash;then perhaps the
        people will come.
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. I can't understand why the burgomaster isn't here? He always
        treated us to brandy other years.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. If you start the song he'll wake up, if he has overslept
        himself. Tune up, gentlemen&mdash;do, mi, sol, do!
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. Then, I'll begin&mdash;but watch out for the trio so as to
        make it a regular ear-splitting ensemble!
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    [Solo Recitative.]
       Hail to thee, Burgomaster!
       Hail to thee, benefactor!
       Life burns our deeds within its envious fire,
       But mem'ry, like a phoenix from the pyre,
       Rises on stalwart wing to waft them higher.
</pre>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Well whistled, Wagonmaker! Any signs of the grog yet?
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. Go on, Shoemaker! Now comes the aria; it must be rendered
        with feeling. Then you shall see that the burgomaster will wake up!
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. [Sings aria.]
      </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            ARIA.

  The breath of the rose and carnation-bud's fragrance, 'mongst
       wonder-flowers' fated!
    As false at heart
    As glitter-wave,
    She held toward him her billowy hair,
    Where all the ocean's freshness breathes.
  And lily so red and lily so white
  Confidingly muse on death and life.
</pre>
      <p>
        CHIROPODIST. That was a rare strophe! But it doesn't seem to have any
        special bearing upon the subject and our present conditions. Where did
        you get it?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Well, you see, I have an apprentice at home who is one of
        your idealists; he does things of this sort when he's free, on Sundays.
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. If I may venture an opinion, I think it inconceivably
        difficult to get at the pith of the strophe.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. That's just the fine point, you see! But hush&mdash;methinks
        we have the rain here. [Puts on coat.]
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. Do the gentlemen think it worth while to stand here in the
        rain and get soaked on that old duffer's account?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. But we are paid to support the song and we must at least do
        the trio before we go; for when we all pitch in together the object
        itself won't be able to sleep! The oration, on the other hand, can be
        given at any time; besides, there is too small a public for so big a
        speech. We'll take the trio&mdash;do, mi, sol, do. It is not as ideal as
        the aria, but it evinces greater familiarity with the specific
        conditions. [Rain patters, wind increases.]
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIROPODIST. Damned if I stand here any longer and catch cold for that
        old charlatan! Remuneration? Six marks each! One can do without that.
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. I think so, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Were you not in on the subscription for the statue, perhaps?
        Were you not there and helped, with a medallion, to turn him into a
        great man?
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. Well, we had to, didn't we? otherwise they would have downed
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. True&mdash;but it is ungrateful not to respect his memory. I
        shall sing the trio alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIROPODIST. Oh, you can do it&mdash;you, with your sou'wester! I'm
        going home to breakfast. [Flings wreath on pedestal, dashes hood of
        cloak over head and runs off.]
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. This is the last time I'm going to lend myself to such
        tomfoolery! Good-bye!
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. [Alone.] And now I'm going to the burgomaster's for a brandy.
        But first, I must deliver my speech to the old man on the pedestal; then
        my conscience will be easier. [Talks to statue.] You think, you old
        Schulze, it is for your sake that we sing, for your sake that we
        speechify; can't you comprehend that we do so for our own sakes? We need
        a big man to push forward when we turn out to be too little ourselves.
        We need your word to quote, since no one credits ours. Our little town
        needed your statue in order to become a great city; your insignificant
        relatives needed your statue to help them get on and find occupation in
        this troublesome world&mdash;and therefore, mark you, you stand so high
        above us all&mdash;a figure for naught but ciphers! Now you have heard a
        true remark, you poor wretch! the first and the last you'll hear,
        perhaps&mdash;[Alarmed.] Surely no one has been listening to what I
        said? Ah! here comes the great man's relative.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Relative.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Good morning, Shoemaker. Have you heard&mdash;have you heard
        of the scurrilous attack?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. What now? What's up, Herr Relative?
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. A reformer has come to the city; haven't you read his
        broad-sheet?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. No, no!
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Oh, it is unprecedented&mdash;read for yourself!
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. I'm too agitated to read; you read it.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Then listen to what the scoundrel writes: "A quarter of a
        century has hardly elapsed since Burgomaster Schulze gladdened this
        community with weighty improvements as regards its street paving, by
        giving us in place of the old sand-ground rough cobble stones." Do you
        hear! Do you hear!
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Yes, I hear. But that was not very alarming.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Not alarming! Doesn't he call him Burgomaster Schulze? One
        does not say burgomaster of a dead man&mdash;one says Our Illustrious&mdash;Does
        not the wretch write about rough cobble stones? Does he not attempt with
        that to undermine <i>his</i> worth?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. But one cannot call it an attack, if he says that cobble
        stones are rough when they are rough.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Of course they are rough, but one must not say that they are
        when a great man is responsible for them. Have a care, Master Shoemaker!
        I see that you are a sceptic. Have a care&mdash;you know the
        consequences!
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. For God's sake, I'm no sceptic! Haven't I been standing here
        chanting odes to brother Schulze?
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Brother! If you were a brother to him in life, please remember
        that all titles are annulled by death. Will you admit that this is an
        attack?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Of course I will&mdash;Have I said anything to the contrary?
        Can you prove that I said anything to the contrary?
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. No; but be careful! We hold Common Council here on the square
        at nine o'clock, when that reformer will speak for his cause. Do you
        know what he wants?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. No.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Can you imagine it! He wants to repave all our streets with
        flagstones.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. But that's rather considerate of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. [Laughs ironically.] Considerate? Oh, very! How will it go,
        for example just to mention your calling&mdash;how will it go with the
        precious shoemaking trade when the people no longer wear out any shoes?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. What&mdash;what say you? Forgive me, my friend, but you are
        right. However, I'm not thinking of my humble calling, but of all the
        poor innocent working men who will be robbed of their bread&mdash;and of
        their poor wives and children!
      </p>
      <p>
        HANS. [At window, makes faces.] Poor unfortunate workingmen!
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. You see, you see! [Pointing to statue.] He was the friend of
        the poor, and he was a man that knew what he did!
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. You may depend upon it that both the wagonmaker and the
        chiropodist will share my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Am I quite sure of that?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. In life and in death!
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Happy the people who respect their great men! [Runs.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter populace. Relative is talking with the wagonmaker and the
        chiropodist.] [The Courthouse clock strikes nine; two trumpeters and a
        drummer come on and sound a call. When the music has ceased Pehr enters,
        and is joined by Street-Paver.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Good morning, master. How do you think this matter will go for me?
      </p>
      <p>
        STREET-PAVER. Badly, very badly!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Don't the people want improvements, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        STREET-PAVER. There's no question as to that&mdash;it's a question of
        the great man's reputation, which you have attacked.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Have I attacked him? [Rain has ceased.]
      </p>
      <p>
        STREET-PAVER. You called him <i>burgomaster</i>, and that title has
        become a by-word in the town; you said that his paving stones were rough&mdash;in
        a word, you have expressed the common opinion of the man, therefore you
        are ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. It's a very remarkable world that we live in!
      </p>
      <p>
        STREET-PAVER. It's rather see-saw, and has its little eccentricities,
        but do not try to help it, sir, for then it will send you straight to
        tophet!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. The people are dissatisfied and when one wants to dig up the cause
        of their dissatisfaction, they throw stones at one! [A boy thrusts a
        leaflet into their hands, hurries along and distributes more among the
        populace.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Glances at leaflet.] But this is outrageous! They have sketched
        us. Have I a nose like that?
      </p>
      <p>
        STREET-PAVER. They have hit us off rather well&mdash;but surely I
        haven't such ears!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I can't understand this&mdash;Yesterday the editor was for the
        cause and to-day he abuses me.
      </p>
      <p>
        STREET-PAVER. Public opinion, you see! He said to me, also, that he
        approved of this movement, but that he stared not defy public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. A curious way of working for his cause! Who, then, is public
        opinion for him?
      </p>
      <p>
        STREET-PAVER. First, the customers; then the burgomaster, money, and
        power.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Then why did he caricature you?
      </p>
      <p>
        STREET-PAVER. Because I entered into your proposition. As a matter of
        course, I did it because I could make money by it. Meantime, he is
        selling hundreds of these poems to-day&mdash;[Trumpets and drum sound;
        Burgomaster, Councilmen and Clerks come out into speakers' cage.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. Well, my children, you must have heard that an impostor has
        come to town.
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. He's no impostor; he is a reformer.
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. It comes to the same thing&mdash;but you must hold your
        tongue, my lad, you have no vote!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Herr Burgomaster, I would beg that my proposition be presented in
        a proper manner before this honored popular assembly&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. Just listen to him! We know his proposition and it simply
        remains for us to express ourselves. Well and good, I consign it to the
        madhouse! It is the man's wish&mdash;think of it, my children! that all
        may be permitted to tread upon smooth pavements. So long as Our Lord
        creates different kinds of human beings, there must be different kinds
        of stones on our streets. Is there anybody who would add further
        remarks?
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. That isn't true! Our Lord does not create different
        kinds of human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. Who gave you permission to shriek?
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. Since we have no voice in things, we may at least be
        allowed to shriek!
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. Yes, shriek, and I'll put you in the lockup! There is no
        one, of course, who has something to add?
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Herr Burgomaster, as a man of honor, may I not be permitted to
        enter a protest against the scandalous attack that has been made?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I challenge the relative!
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. And I, on the other hand, attach more weight to the
        Relative's utterance since he is allied to a great man; that is always
        the community's best guarantee&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        ROOSTER. [From hen-coop outside the shoemaker's.] Cockelicoo!
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. What's that devilish racket?
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. That's one who is blessed with a voice!
      </p>
      <p>
        ROOSTER. Cockelicoo!
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. Arrest him! [Laughter and groans.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. Quiet, back there! Secondly: Said adventurer has spoken
        outrageously of the administration in that he has made defamatory
        speeches against the city's departed burgomaster. We would hear a few
        impartial citizens&mdash;Master Shoemaker, what, in your opinion, does
        he merit?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. I vote with the administration.
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. Quite right; he should be held in contempt. What say you,
        Master Chiropodist?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIROPODIST. I concur.
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. And the wagonmaker?
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. I have the honor to agree with the last speaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. Those who have the right to speak are silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. Silence, back there! On the ground of what has already been
        advanced, with the support of conclusive evidence, the adventurer named
        Pehr [no family name] is hereby sentenced for vicious utterances against
        the administration to stand in the pillory two hours, later to be
        expelled from the city, to his everlasting disgrace and as a warning to
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Herr Burgomaster, the proofs are lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. We require none. Axiom, or self-evident points, neither can
        nor need be proved. Away with him! [Pehr is led off.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. Thirdly: In consideration of the vexatious as well as
        unforeseen incident that the city's dogs give unseemly expression to
        their inward feelings for the hideous around the pedestal of Hans
        Schulze's statue, an appropriation is demanded for an iron railing
        around the same. Surely no one will refuse a deserving man such trifling
        act of respect?
      </p>
      <p>
        QUALIFIED VOTERS. No!
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. That is the first time we've heard the voters say no!
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. Officer, put him in the lockup! The question has been
        answered, then, in the affirmative.
      </p>
      <p>
        QUALIFIED VOTERS. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. [Makes noise like a sheep.] B-a-a-a! [An instant of
        laughter and commotion.]
      </p>
      <p>
        BURGOMASTER. The Common Council is adjourned. [Trumpets and drum sound,
        after which silence on stage.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. [To Shoemaker.] He's an uncommonly firm expeditor, that
        burgomaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. He ought to be in the Legislature&mdash;then it would go a
        little faster with the common motions.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Burgomaster, Councilmen and Secretary go into Courthouse. People
        continue to circulate on square; Street-paver keeps aloof.]
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. [To Chiropodist, Wagonmaker and Relative.] Gentlemen, won't
        you sit down and drink a glass of ale with me?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIROPODIST, WAGONMAKER, RELATIVE. Thank you!
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. [At door, gives order; Hans brings on ale.] Well, Herr
        Relative, you did not choose to be present this morning at the memorial
        fest for your illustrious kinsman?
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Where was the need of my going out in the rain? You were there
        with the Society.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. The whole Society! There were three of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Did you sing?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIROPODIST. Yes, a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. [Laughing.] Were there many people?
      </p>
      <p>
        WAGONMAKER. Not a soul!
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. And the burgomaster&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Overslept himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. [Laughing.] Have you seen the <i>Morning Crow</i>?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALL. No.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. [Takes up a pamphlet.] Would you like to hear, then&mdash;"<i>Tribute</i>.
        The customary tribute paid by the Schulze Society to the memory of our
        worthy citizen, whom we commemorate in bronze on the city's public
        square, took place this morning in presence of a great crowd of people
        that greeted the memorial songs, sung in honor of the illustrious
        departed, with hearty applause. The songs were rendered by the great
        chorus with the usual precision and good ensemble. The oration, which
        had been prepared with the utmost care, was delivered in clear, resonant
        tones by the worthy shoemaker, Pumpen-Block. Among the notables present
        we observed the city's burgomaster, the kinsman of the departed, and
        others." [All laugh.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Isn't that rich?
      </p>
      <p>
        ALL. Oh, it's priceless!&mdash;You wrote that.
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. By the by, have you seen the cartoon of the reformer and the
        street-paver? It's capital!
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. But it was a bit extravagant to caricature them in that way!
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. Oh, no sensible person has anything against the proposition;
        but that it should fall into such hands&mdash;Hush, here he comes!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Pehr is led on by guards, who place him in the pillory and adjust
        neck-irons. The populace nudge each other and point at him. Shoemaker's
        company slightly embarrassed. Enter a lyre player and an old blind
        woman, with a painted canvas on a pole. Old woman sings and points at
        canvas, which is painted in six panels&mdash;one for each stanza.]
      </p>
      OLD WOMAN.
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    There was a guileless youth
      Who heard the people's wail;
    Lawgivers sat in the square
      And gaily quaffed their ale.

    The youth to the people said:
      "I would make your pathway fair!"
    "There's trouble," the rulers cried,
      "Sedition breeds in the air."

    Still they sat in the square,
      And still they quaffed their ale;
    They talked of the people's good,
      But heard not the people's wail.

    The youth in the pillory stood,
      For there he'd been given his place;
    In the wag'nmaker's hen-coop the cock crew
      As of yore in Caiphas' palace.

    The great respect the law,
      Their own renown they buy
    With statues and tombs and gold
      To praise them when they die.

    The people pass under the yoke,
      They wail through the vigils of night,
    And wait till the cock shall crow
      To herald an era of light.
</pre>
      <p>
        [Shoemaker's company make wry faces and pretend not to be listening; the
        people are interested and drop pennies into the old woman's bank. The
        women are moved to tears and wipe their eyes now and then.]
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. [To shoemaker.] Have you many orders now-a-days?
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Oh, so-so&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD WOMAN. Give the old blind woman a coin?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHIROPODIST. Begging is prohibited, don't you know that?
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. She's not begging; she asks remuneration.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. What kind of rot is he talking?
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. The Schulze Society is paid to sing for the statue
        yonder, but the men pocket the coins and stay away. This morning only
        three were there.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. [To his guests.] Think, they know all that goes on, the
        villains!
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD WOMAN. Give the blind old woman a coin!
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. One must pay, to boot, for her croaking?
      </p>
      <p>
        ONE OF THE PEOPLE. She sings better than the shoemaker sang this
        morning, when we stood round the corner listening to him. He certainly
        does not sing ideally about carnations and roses, but a true word spoken
        at the right moment is also ideal!
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. If you don't go, old hag, you'll be locked up!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Thunder and lightning, wind, rain, commotion.]
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. Egad! it's raining again. Step inside, gentlemen. [They break
        up.]
      </p>
      <p>
        OLD WOMAN. Must that poor wretch in the pillory stand out in the rain?
      </p>
      <p>
        RELATIVE. If my kinsman, who is so great a personage, can stand outside,
        then that fellow may as well stay where he is.
      </p>
      <p>
        SHOEMAKER. It cools these reformers off so nicely to get a little cold
        water over them. [Trips, stubs toe against a stone.] The damned cobble
        stones! [Hops into house on one leg. Exit all but Pehr and Old Woman&mdash;Lisa.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. [Throws off disguise.] Well, Pehr! You have become a famous man;
        your name is now on every one's lips, your picture is being carried
        round on all streets and public squares and the people hail you as a
        reformer. Are you satisfied?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, Lisa, now I am satisfied with being a reformer!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Shall you leave your work half-done?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, Lord save us! If only I can escape with my skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. You sought glory and renown&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But all do that!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Not all. But you had the approval of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. The people! They have nothing to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. So it was the approval of the great that you wanted. Then stand
        there and be ashamed! You did not even believe in the cause for which
        you stood.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Frankly, I think it a matter of slight consequence whether one
        walks upon smooth or rough stones.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. When one walks in calfskin boots&mdash;yes; but not when one goes
        barefooted!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Moreover, the community isn't worth a straw; the whole thing is
        only a sham! <i>The common good, the common good</i>&mdash;one never
        talks of anything else. What, then, is the common good? It strikes me as
        being an agreement between a few private individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. It should be everyone's good, but it isn't. Make it so, and it
        will be so.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I want to&mdash;oh, I want to do it, but I haven't the power!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Then get it, Pehr, and let's see if I have made a mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Breaks irons and comes down stage.] You shall see, Lisa, that I
        will do something big when I have the power.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Why something big? Something good would be better.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But you must always be by my side, Lisa. What was it that the bird
        in the wood sang?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. That I will tell you next time.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No, now!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. He said: "I love you!"
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Won't you love me, Lisa?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Yes, when you love me.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But I do!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. No, you do not; so far you love only yourself. Out again, Pehr,
        and learn something! There are not many wishes left to you; the greatest
        but most dangerous one is ahead of you&mdash;Power! That is the highest
        thing a frail mortal can attain. But woe to him who misuses it! He is
        the world's greatest criminal, for he makes a caricature of Our Blessed
        Lord! Farewell, King! thy crown awaits thee! [Disappears.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh, my queen!

        SCENE ONE.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Interior of a palace in Oriental style. To right a throne, before it a
        table, with royal regalia; to left a divan, pillows arranged on floor in
        a semi-circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        At rise of curtain The Ameer discovered lying on floor writing on a
        paper scroll.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Chamberlain of the Caliph.]
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. Is that the young Caliph's genealogical chart?
      </p>
      <p>
        AMEER. Yes, Chamberlain.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. It certainly looks very imposing. Whom leave you given him
        as progenitor?
      </p>
      <p>
        AMEER. Caliph Omar, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. I think that Haroun-al-Raschid would have been better.
      </p>
      <p>
        AMEER. He was certainly more popular&mdash;but in that case our gracious
        sovereign would not be related to the ancient house.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. Very true. Will you be ready soon? We expect him at any
        moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        AMEER. Has your Excellency seen the new caliph?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. Yes; he looks like all the rest&mdash;It is only the
        genealogical tree that separates him from us.
      </p>
      <p>
        AMEER. Yes, the genealogical tree!
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. [Examines ancestral chart again.] You have got an awful
        width to it!
      </p>
      <p>
        AMEER. I had to put in a bastard line; it looks so flourishing on paper,
        and gives to the race a semblance of strength, which is always
        flattering.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. [Laughs.] What will the Caliph Omar say to this?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Court Mullah.]

      <p>
        MULLAH. Allah akbar barai! How dost?

      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. Allah! Eloim! I thank you, excellently.
      </p>
      <p>
        MULLAH. Is the Renunciation Act made out in duplicate form?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. In duplicate form. Will you be good enough to compare, then
        he will only have to add his signature.
      </p>
      <p>
        MULLAH. If there's time enough, it would be the better way.

        [Chamberlain takes two papers from table and hands one to the Mullah.]
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. [Reads aloud.] "We, Omar the twenty-seventh, do hereby
        solemnly forswear our&mdash;the Roman Catholic&mdash;faith, and adopt

      <p>
        [Enter Pehr&mdash;Grand Vizier and Royal Historian having entered just
        before him. Ameer jumps up from the floor with the genealogical chart;
        Royal Historian stands quietly and jots down in a book what he hears.]
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Will it please Your Highness to scan this ancestral chart, which
        our&mdash;and the Kingdom's Ameer has made of Your Highness' illustrious
        old family tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. My ancestral chart? I have never known of any relative but my
        father, the old sexton.
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. [Pretends not to hear.] It begins with a great and glorious name&mdash;Caliph
        Omar&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Caliph Omar! What kind of fish is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. [Sternly.] That is no fish. He was a great and honorable ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Be that as it may, but I was born in wedlock and not between satin
        sheets, good gentlemen!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. It does not become a ruler to be selfish; he must in all
        particulars sacrifice his personal interests and tastes for the welfare
        of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Very good; but does the welfare of the people demand that I shall
        be illegitimate?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Then hand me the paper! [Ameer delivers ancestral chart and a
        pen.] It begins with a lie, and will probably end with theft. [Signs.]
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. There remains a slight formality&mdash;Will it please Your
        Highness to sign this paper also. [Mullah presents Renunciation Act.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What now?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Your Highness need not trouble himself to road; it is only a
        matter of form.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Renounce my forefathers' Faith&mdash;But that outrageous!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Political considerations&mdash;the people's welfare&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I must become a Mohammedan and may not drink a glass of wine?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. There are substitutes in all politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What are they?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Compromises, modifications&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Circumventions, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Will it please Your Highness to sign?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But I shall despise myself if I begin with a low action, and all
        the more will the people have the right to despise me!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. The people demand that the ruler sacrifice all personal
        considerations for their welfare.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Their welfare, then, is to be built upon a lie and a crime?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. [Goes toward window.] Your Highness, the people await their
        chief. They are always ready to offer their sweat and blood for the
        ruler, therefore they demand, also, that the ruler make his sacrifices.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Is what you say true? Well, then, give it me! [Accepts paper&mdash;hesitates.]
        The belfry, the chimes, the singing, the lights, Christmas&mdash;all
        pass before mine eyes! No more Christmas Eve! Life is so pitiless; it
        only demands, but never gives anything!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Your Highness, the people are clamoring! They would see their
        chief in the attire of the old caliphs&mdash;the crown and sceptre await
        to be borne anew by a branch of the old ancestral tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Catches sight of crown and sceptre.] Ah! Vizier, who can command
        me to forswear my faith?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. The laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who made the laws?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Our forefathers.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. They were weak mortals, like ourselves. Well and good, I'll make
        over all the laws!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. The Caliph does not reconstruct laws, for our form of
        administration has not given him law-making rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What is the form of administration in this land?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Constitutional Despotism.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Answer! Am I Caliph, or not?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. You will be as soon as you have affixed your signature.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Then hand me the paper! [Signs. Enter Viziers, Court Attendants,
        etc. Crowning Ceremony.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEOPLE. [Without.] Long live Omar the twenty-seventh! Allah, Allah,
        Allah!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Will it please Your Royal Highness to ascend the throne and
        begin the reign?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. That will be quite diverting. Admit the people!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. The people? The people have nothing to do with the Government!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But surely I shall have someone to rule over?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. That is done in writing. [Takes out a few documents.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Proceed!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. In order to spare Your Royal Highness the weighty burdens of
        government on this, the first day of his reign, we have tabled all
        petitions but one, which can very easily be disposed of.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. That was stupid, but it can't be helped now. Let's hear it!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Aschmed Sheik, with face in the dust and with his heart's
        prayers, begs that he may go over to the Sunnees' faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What is the Sunnees' faith?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. It is a sect, a dangerous sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. In what particular does it differ from the&mdash;ahem!&mdash;true
        doctrine?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. A true Moslem greets Allah in this manner&mdash;[crosses hands
        on breast] but a sectarian does like this&mdash;[Pinches his nose and
        pokes his fingers into his ears.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Laughing.] Well, can't the man poke his fingers in his ears?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. No; the laws of the land do not permit it.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. There is no religious liberty, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Yes, for the <i>true</i> faith.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But for the others?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. There must be no others!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Then I shall give them religious liberty!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. That the Caliph can not do.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who can, then?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. The Government alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who is the government?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Vizier and all others present place a finger to mouth.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. A secret?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. That is the constitutional despotism's secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But I had the liberty of changing the religion?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Politics is another matter!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Then God save all peoples from politics! Must I begin my reign
        with the refusal of an humble petition?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Your Highness cannot begin better than by strengthening the laws
        of the realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. But I'll never sign!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. It is not necessary; the Administration will attend to that. The
        Cabinet is adjourned. Will it please Your Highness to lay aside his
        official attire and return to private life, with its petty diversions.
        The Chamberlain is at Your Highness' service. [Goes.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [The Chamberlain removes Caliph's crown and sceptre and conducts him to
        divan. Enter Dancers, Singers and Poet Laureate. The Dance.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What is this company?
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. This is the Court.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Why do they wear such short dresses? I do not like that custom.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. It is the custom of the country, Your Highness.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. This at least is not politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. The first Court Singer begs that she may entertain Your
        Highness with an idealistic song written by the celebrated poet
        laureate, Hourglass-Link.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Be good enough to entertain me!

      <p>
        SINGER. [With lute, sings.]

    Then say farewell to Horaire, the march is already broken.
    O army, hast thou the strength to say a farewell!

      <p>
        PEHR. Where's the rhyme?
      </p>
      <p>
        POET LAUREATE. There are no rhymes in this kind of poetry.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. That's bad! Continue&mdash;

        AMEER. [Aside to historian.] He's not long for this place.

        SINGER. Your Highness must pardon me, but I am indisposed to-day.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Chamberlain, is there not something in the constitution called
        bastinado?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Panic.]
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. Assuredly&mdash;but&mdash;

        PEHR. [To singer.] Continue, then!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
SINGER. [Sings.]    Marble brow, flowing hair, sparkling rows of teeth,
    She steps as light as the pacer, lest she soil her hoof in the mud.

SINGER.    Swelling bosom, slender waist, throbbing now anew;

        POET LAUREATE. Your Highness, I have not learned to flatter.
      </p>

        strophe so we may hear if you lie.

  My love for hinds I leave and cherish a noble prince,

  The prince who hath vanquished his foemen. Whatever the cost might be,
  Strong in the Faith is he! Heresy's dreaded scourge!
</pre>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Springs to his feet.] Do you mean it seriously or are you joking?
      </p>
      <p>
        POET LAUREATE. I mean it seriously, Your Highness. How should anything
        else be&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Indeed! It is in all seriousness, then, that you praise my low
        actions?

      <p>
        POET LAUREATE. Your Highness stands as high above low actions as the sun
        above a mud-puddle!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I know you and your gang, counterfeiter! You call me, who
        foreswore my faith, the Defender of the Faith; you say that I, a
        bell-ringer's son, am of royal descent; that I am generous, who refused
        to grant the first humble petition presented since my coming to the
        throne! I know you, for your kind is to be found the world over. You
        live for thought and immortality, you say; but you are never seen when a
        thought is to be born; you are never felt when it comes to a question of
        immortality. But around heaped up dishes, in the sunlight of affluence
        and power, there you swarm, like fat meat flies, only to fly away that
        you may set black specks upon those who can let themselves be slain for
        both thought and immortality. Out of my sight, liar! I would have your
        head removed did I not see the shadow of a purpose in your presence. A
        poor ruler is forced by political considerations to do so many
        despicable things that he would die of shame did he not have an
        institution like you to dull his conscience continually. Go! I would be
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAMBERLAIN. Your Highness, it cannot be.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. It can be! [All go out except Pehr and Royal Historian.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What are you waiting for? What do you do?
      </p>
      <p>
        HISTORIAN. I am writing Your Highness' history.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. So you are Court Historian.
      </p>
      <p>
        HISTORIAN. Royal&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What matter, once you're dead! But what shall you write about? I
        have never carried on any wars.
      </p>
      <p>
        HISTORIAN. That is just what I wish to speak about. Your Highness only
        need turn to the Minister of War&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Then he will arrange one; that is his occupation, and for that he
        is paid 20,000 shekels.
      </p>
      <p>
        HISTORIAN. It is the people, Your Highness, who&mdash;

        PEHR. The bride! Who? Where? What does it mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Your Highness' consort.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Lisa! She loves me still, despite all my faults? Conduct her
        hither. She shall bring the fresh air of the forest into these musty
        halls!
      </p>
      <p>
        VIZIER. Your Highness wished first to sign the marriage contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I'm forever writing! No, this time I don't have to read. [Signs.]
        Now, Royal Historian, you can put down at least one action in my life
        that was not crime! [Vizier and Historian go.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Bride, veiled in Oriental fashion, is ushered in; attendants withdraw
        immediately; from behind is heard soft music.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Runs toward bride.] Lisa, Lisa! You always come like a sunbeam
        when the clouds thicken&mdash;always like a friend in the dark hour!
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. [Raises veil.] My name is not Lisa.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Not Lisa&mdash;What does this mean? Treachery! Who are you then?
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. Your consort.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. My consort!
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. [Indifferently.] The Administration had three candidates for you:
        The Vizier's choice fell upon me because my father threatened you with a
        tariff treaty.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. The administration's candidate&mdash;tariff treaties&mdash;what
        does that signify?
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. Politics require that princes shall sacrifice their personal
        considerations for the good of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Politics require&mdash;But does the good of the people require any
        princes?
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. I don't know&mdash;but it's done once for all, and now you are my
        husband. Have the goodness to be happy, or you will be miserable.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Are you happy?
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. I am nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Do you love me?
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. No, certainly not! And you me?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No!
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. You love your Lisa?

        PEHR. O misery and lamentation!
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. Calm yourself a moment&mdash;One moment, while they come in and
        congratulate us. The bridal procession is waiting without. Silence! They
        are nearing; stand at my side!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Must I go forth again, and jest?
      </p>
      <p>
        BRIDE. Obey me, for I'm a wise woman! When they go I shall tell you my
        plan. Here they come! Look pleasant, husband, else they will say that I
        made you unhappy.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Dear old father, how right you were! Black is black and can never
        be white. [Pehr and bride seat themselves on divan and assume a
        sentimental attitude.]

        oak's trunk to lean upon; a happy people, youthful princess, rejoice in
        your good fortune and hope that your tree may have off-shoots with fresh

        PEHR. Hell and Damnation! You grand vizier of lies! and you, dressed up
        adventurers, are you my people! Are these hired maidens, with their
        venal tricks, my people who pay taxes to us that we may say nay to their
        humblest request? No! I have never seen my people. Is this young woman,
        whom you have placed by my side, my mate who loves me? No&mdash;She is a
        heifer that you have let into my stall; she is an imp who is to shoot
        branches on the genealogical tree; she is an administration's candidate
        who makes happy her spouse with a tariff treaty. You call us happy
        because we pretend to be; but we are most unhappy, for we stand near the
        brink of a crime, which, praise God, we shall never commit. I curse you,
        palace! dedicated as a temple of lies. Down in the dust with you, false
        family tree! [Genealogical chart drops from wall and rolls up on floor.]
        Break into shatters, crown and sceptre, tyranny's symbols! [Crown and
        sceptre come down with a crash.] Tumble throne, where unrighteousness is
        seated! [Throne collapses. Thunder, lightning, storm.] Scatter like
        decoys, fortune hunters and outcasts that have placed yourselves between
        noble and commoner! [All but bride disappear. To bride.] You lamb of
        sacrifice, be free like myself! Now I want to go out into Nature and see

        pois'n-filled vapours; Sing wave, and let mine ear be soothed By the
        harmonies of thy pure tones, As I stand here 'mongst the wreckage on the
        strand, A wreck myself, which the breakers cast upon the sand When the
        vessel crashed 'gainst the sharp cliff-rocks! Be greeted, Sea, that
        nurses healthy thoughts And recreates the soul in shrunken body When
        every spring thy billows break And gull and swallow chatter 'bove thy
        wave, To wak'n anew the joy of life, and strength, and hope!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Sees hut.]
      </p>
      <p>
        What's this? A human habitation! Not even here is a moment's peace
        granted me&mdash;Maledictions!
      </p>
      <p>
        A VOICE. Curse not!
      </p>
      <p>
        [It darkens and the sea begins to rise, moving toward him during
        following speech so that he is forced down stage.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who spoke? [Tries to flee toward left and is met by elk.] Wild
        beasts stop me! [Tries to flee toward right, but is intercepted by
        bulls.] Even here&mdash;Back! [Animals come on stage and crowd around
        him.] They surround me! Help! [Runs to but and knocks.] Is no one here?
        Help, help! [Attempts to cast himself into the sea, but sea-serpents and
        dragons rise up.] Ah, nature, even you are a savage monster that would
        devour all you come upon! You, my last friend, tricked me also&mdash;What
        terror's visions! The sea would swallow me. What is my life worth more?
        Come, Death, and set me free! [Sea gradually subsides.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Death; beasts vanish.]
      </p>
      <p>
        DEATH. Here am I, at your service! What would you me?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Cowers, but recovers himself.] Oh, really!&mdash;It was nothing
        especially pressing&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        DEATH. You called me!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Did I actually do that? Well, it is only a form of speech which we
        use; I really want nothing of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        DEATH. But I want something of you! Stand straight on your legs and I'll
        cut; it will be over in no time. [Raises scythe.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Mercy, mercy! I don't want to die!
      </p>
      <p>
        DEATH. Bosh! What has life to offer you who have no wishes left?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. That one does not know; if one might stop to consider, then
        perhaps&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        DEATH. Oh, you have had ample time; now it is too late. Straighten your
        back so that you may fall like a real world-hater! [Lifts scythe.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No, no, for God's sake, wait a little&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        DEATH. You're a timid beggar! Live on then if you think it anything; but
        don't regret it later. I shall not come again for a long time. [Starts
        to go.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. No, no, no! don't leave me alone&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        DEATH. Alone? Why, you have lovely Nature!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, it's all very well when the weather is fine and the sun
        shines, but thus late&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        DEATH. You see now that you cannot live without your fellow men. Knock
        three times on the door over yonder, and you will find company. [Death
        vanishes. Pehr knocks three times on door of hut; the Wise Man comes
        out.]
      </p>
      <p>
        WISE MAN. Whom seek you?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. A human being! In short&mdash;I'm unhappy.
      </p>
      <p>
        WISE MAN. Then you should not seek human beings, for they cannot help
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. I know it, yet I would neither live nor die; I have suffered all,
        and my heart will not break!
      </p>
      <p>
        WISE MAN. You are young, and do not know the human heart. In here I have
        lately been pondering the causes of mankind's misery. Would you like to
        see how the little object called the human heart looks? [Steps into hut
        and returns presently with a casket and a lantern, which he hangs on a
        tree.]
      </p>
      <p>
        You see the little three-cornered muscle, which now has ceased to beat&mdash;Once
        it throbbed with rage, thumped with joy, cramped with sorrow, swelled
        with hope. You see that it is divided into two large chambers: In one
        lives the good, in the other the evil&mdash;or, with a word, there sits
        an angel on one side of the wall and a devil on the other. When they
        chance to be at odds with each other&mdash;which happens quite often&mdash;there
        is unrest in the person and he fancies the heart will burst&mdash;but it
        doesn't, for the walls are thick. Oh, yes, look at this one! Do you see
        thousands of little scars from needle thrusts? They did not go through,
        but the pricks remain nevertheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Who has borne this heart, Wise Man?
      </p>
      <p>
        WISE MAN. The unhappiest of humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And who was that?
      </p>
      <p>
        WISE MAN. It was a man. Do you see the marks of a heel; do you see the
        nail-prints? It was a woman that trampled on this heart for twenty-six
        years.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. And he did not tire?
      </p>
      <p>
        WISE MAN. Yes, he grew weary one Christmas Eve and freed himself from
        her. As a punishment, he came under the ban of the Powers; he cannot
        die, although his heart has been taken from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Can he never be released from the spell?
      </p>
      <p>
        WISE MAN. When his son shall have found a faithful woman and brought her
        home a bride, then the spell will be broken. But that can never be
        because his son is gone forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What has become of him?
      </p>
      <p>
        WISE MAN. He went out in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Then why can he never get any bride, poor boy!
      </p>
      <p>
        WISE MAN. Because one who loves only himself can never love anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. He means the old man, my father. [Wise Man sinks through floor;
        but vanishes. It begins to dawn.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. "He who loves only himself "&mdash;So said Lisa also&mdash;But I
        hate myself, I loathe myself after the cowardly things I have done, and
        I love Lisa! Yes, I love her, I love her! [Sun shines on waves and
        lights up pine woods to right; clouds disperse. A boat is seen out at
        sea, it comes nearer and nearer and Lisa is seen at the rudder. She
        beckons to Pehr as the boat recedes.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Sea-gulls in the air, tell her! Sunbeams, carry my words on your pillars
        of fire, and bear them to her. But where must I seek thee&mdash;where?
        [Boat is seen on horizon a moment.] It is she! Now, ring, fulfill my
        last wish and take me to her! The ring is gone! Woe, what does this
        augur? Is my story ended, or shall it now begin perhaps? Lisa, my soul's
        belovd! [He runs up on cliff and waves.] If you hear me, answer; if you
        see me, give me a sign! Ah&mdash;she turns out toward the fjord&mdash;Well,
        then, storm and sea, that separate me from all that my heart loves, I
        challenge you to battle for the highest prize! [Pushes out boat drawn up
        on shore.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Blow, wind, and rock, wave! My weak keel shall cleave you like a sword.
        On, my boat, even though we miss the goal, let us struggle on till we
        sink!

        ACT FIVE
      </h2>
      <p>
        SCENE: Interior of a little country church, with frescoed ceiling. At
        back, centre, altar with crucifix; to left, pulpit; on a pillar down
        left an image of Saint Bartholomew with skin in hand; directly opposite,
        on a pillar, image of Saint Laurence with the grill. Broom is propped
        against altar railing. Two rows of praying stools at right and left
        sides form an aisle from front to altar. At right a confessional; at
        left an iron door.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The Elf stands in one window, the Fairy in the other.]
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. It was not the old man that ate up the porridge, it was the rats.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Then it was not to do Pehr a kindness that you sent him out in
        the world, but to harm the old man!
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. Even we immortals can make mistakes. Let, us make amends for our
        fault.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. If it is not too late?
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. How so?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Pehr is a misanthrope and cannot become reconciled to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. Lisa will rectify all that, and then the old man will have atoned
        for his sin. One must patch where one has torn.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. I have already made my preparations.
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. Here?
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Here in this sanctuary whose floor we may not tread.
      </p>
      <p>
        ELF. And why not? True, it is holy ground, and we were not allowed to
        become participants in the Great Redemption because&mdash;well, because
        something which we mustn't know about came between. But that does not
        prevent the humans from believing some good of us; and in that they do
        right, for the matter has its sides. Meantime, I shall not absent myself&mdash;even
        if I may not be near to witness that this reconciliation comes out all
        right. Even we lost souls can rejoice in the happiness of others.
        Farewell, but not for long.
      </p>
      <p>
        FAIRY. Farewell. [Elf and Fairy vanish.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Lisa.]
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Here in this peaceful church the good fairy promised me that I
        should meet him&mdash;How shall I behold him now? Has he learned aught
        of life, or is he still the same selfish, pleasure-loving youth who
        pursues only fickle fortune? If he had had the courage to do a bad act
        in a good cause, then he would at least have shown that he could make a
        sacrifice for something besides himself; for the most that we can give
        to a cause is our precious regard for ourselves. Higher powers demand
        that such and such shall take place; they choose the instruments where
        they will and none may give up the commission, even if it means going
        under. My friend was not that sort, and therefore, therefore&mdash;Hush!
        I hear footsteps&mdash;It is he! No, I would not meet him yet; I must
        collect my thoughts. If I conceal myself here&mdash;in the confessional&mdash;[Steps
        in.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter Pehr.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Drops down on a prayer stool, left.] She flees from me, as I flee
        from my bad thoughts! Alone, forsaken&mdash;what more is there for me in
        life? Naught have I learned of life save its nothingness, and no wishes
        are left to me but evil ones. My soul would be like an empty shell were
        it not filled with her! My life&mdash;Ah, what has it been? [Pall pounds
        on floor.] What was that?&mdash;Ghosts in the sunshine? That would be a
        funny sight! [Broom raps on floor.] Again! 'Tis said that one can see
        ghosts in broad daylight, if one peeps through a door-crack, it is even
        maintained that one can see oneself. <i>Oneself</i>&mdash;! If one could
        really do that, how easy it would be to evade one's worst faults! I'll
        try it. [Opens door left and places himself behind it.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Pehr's shadow steps up into the pulpit, drinks from the goblet, and
        turns hour-glass. Pehr stands at door with back to spectators.]
      </p>
      <p>
        SHADOW. My beloved hearers! [Pall, Broom, Bartholomew and Laurence
        stir.] My beloved hearers and you, Pehr, who stand behind the door, my
        sermon will not be long since the hour is already late and it is
        especially to this so-called <i>Lucky Pehr</i> that I would address a
        few remarks. Yes, you, Pehr&mdash;you have rushed through life like a
        fool, in pursuit of fortune; all your wishes have been fulfilled&mdash;save
        one and they have brought you no happiness. Pay attention, you who stand
        behind the door! You have made no leap through life, for on that track
        one runs well. All the experiences through which you think you have
        passed were but dreams; for, believe me, one wins no wishes with
        luck-rings out here in Reality; here one gains nothing without labor. Do
        you know what labor is?&mdash;No! It is something very heavy; but it
        must be heavy the sweeter the repose&mdash;Labor, Pehr, and be honest,
        but don't become a saint, for then you would be vain, and it is not our
        virtues but our faults that make us human. Listen well, you who stand
        behind the door&mdash;Life is not such as you saw it in your youthful
        dreams. It is a desert, that is true; but a desert which has its
        flowers; it is a stormy sea, but one that has its ports by verdant
        isles. Heed, Pehr! If you want to go forth into life now, then do it in
        earnest. But you will never be a <i>real</i> man without a woman&mdash;Find
        her! And now, pay close attention, Pehr, for I shall leave the word to
        Saint Laurence after dismissing you with the sage's eternally young and
        eternally old exhortation&mdash;Know thyself! Saint Laurence has the
        word. [Shadow vanishes.]
      </p>
      <p>
        SAINT LAURENCE. [Presents his grill.] I am the holy Saint Laurence with
        the grill, who, at Emperor Dicii's command was beaten with thongs seven
        days in succession and afterwards was broiled on this grill by a slow
        fire. There is no one who has suffered so much as I!
      </p>
      <p>
        SAINT BARTHOLOMEW. What is that to speak of! I am the holy Saint
        Bartholomew with the skin, who, at Emperor Pamphilii's command was
        flayed alive clear down to the knees; and what miracles happened after
        my death! You perhaps have never heard of the mysteries or of the devil
        in woman shape and the prognostication about the volcano?
      </p>
      <p>
        SAINT LAURENCE. What is that to speak of as compared with mine? I have
        six miracles: The beam in the church, the crystal chalice, the Nun's
        corpse&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        PALL. [Rises up.] Oh, boast moderately of your sufferings. I am only a
        pall, but for fifty years I have borne on my back so many corpses, and
        have seen so much suffering&mdash;so many shattered hopes, so much
        inconsolable grief, so many torn hearts that suffered in silence and
        were thrust into oblivion without the solace of gilded statues&mdash;that
        you would be silent had you seen one-half of it. Ah, life is so black,
        so black, so black!
      </p>
      <p>
        BROOM. [Raps on floor and rustles its straws.] What&mdash;you chatter
        about life, old Pall, you who have seen only death? Life is black on one
        side and white on the other. To-day I'm only a broom, but yesterday I
        stood in the forest, so stout and trim, and wanted to be something
        great. They all want to be great, you see, so it happened as it
        happened! Now I think like this: What comes is best; since you couldn't
        be great, you may as well be something else; there is so much to choose
        from&mdash;One may of course be useful, and at worst one can content
        oneself with being good, and when one has not been given two legs to
        stand on, one must be happy anyhow and hop on one. [Broom goes bumping
        along and finally leans against altar.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. [Walks rapidly over to holy-water fount, by confessional, takes
        holy-water sprinkler and sprinkles out into the church.] Away, spectres
        and evil spirits! [As he lays back sprinkler a noise is heard from the
        confessional.] Someone is there! Reverend Father, hear me and accept the
        sighs of a broken heart!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. [In assumed voice&mdash;from confessional.] Speak, my son.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. How shall I leave my dreams?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Oh, you have dreamed enough and you are no longer young. Think of
        your missteps&mdash;have you not made such?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes, I have pursued fortune and have sacrificed conscience and
        honor in order to win fame and power. Now I cannot bear misfortune, and
        hate myself!
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Then you have ceased to love yourself above all else?
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Yes.&mdash;I would free myself from <i>self</i>&mdash;if I could.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Then, Pehr, you can also love another.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Oh, yes! But where shall I seek her?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. [Comes out.] Here! [They embrace.]
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. Now you will not leave me again?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. No, Pehr, for now I believe you love me.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. What good fairy sent you across my pathway?
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. Do you still believe in good fairies? Mark you, when a little baby
        boy is born into the world, a little baby girl is also born somewhere;
        and they seek and seek until they find each other. Sometimes they go
        amiss as to the right one, then it turns out badly; sometimes they never
        find each other, then there is much sorrow and affliction; but when they
        find each other, then there is joy, and it is the greatest joy life
        holds.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. It is Paradise Found!
      </p>
      <p>
        [Enter sexton, with staff&mdash;The old Man in the tower.]
      </p>
      <p>
        SEXTON. The church must be closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        LISA. See, now he drives us from Paradise!
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR. That he cannot do.&mdash;We carry it with us and lay it, like the
        verdant isle, out in the stormy sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEXTON. [Lays down his staff.] Alongside the peaceful harbor, where the
        waves break up and go to rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        PEHR AND LISA. Father! Father! [Fairy and Elf appear, each in their
        window.]
      </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
